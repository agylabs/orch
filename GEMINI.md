# Orch - Antigravity Demo Orchestration

## Project Intent

This repository serves as the orchestration hub for managing Google Antigravity demonstration repositories within the `agylabs` organization.

## Purpose

**Orch** is designed to streamline the creation, configuration, and management of demo repositories that showcase Google Antigravity's capabilities. It provides a centralized location for:

- **Repository Management**: Tools and scripts to programmatically create new demo repositories in the `agylabs` organization
- **Configuration Templates**: Standardized templates for demo projects to ensure consistency across demonstrations
- **Automation Workflows**: Automated setup and deployment processes for rapid demo environment provisioning
- **Documentation**: Best practices and guidelines for creating effective Antigravity demonstrations

## Key Capabilities

### Current
- Project structure and intent documentation
- Foundation for repository orchestration tooling

### Planned
- **Automated Repository Creation**: Scripts leveraging GitHub APIs to create and configure new demo repositories
- **Template System**: Pre-configured project templates for common Antigravity use cases
- **Demo Lifecycle Management**: Tools for setting up, updating, and archiving demonstration repositories
- **Integration Workflows**: CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation for demo environments
- **Inventory Management**: Tracking and cataloging all active demonstration repositories

## Target Audience

This repository is intended for:
- Google Antigravity team members creating demonstrations
- Product managers showcasing Antigravity capabilities
- Engineers building proof-of-concept applications
- Anyone needing to quickly spin up Antigravity demo environments
